# Pinto-and-Jung-Lit-Review-2024

## Overview
In the past decade, several quantitative models and risk assessments for Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) and _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been developed to guide the management of these pathogens in fresh-produce. However, there is a need to collect and critically review the parameters used to guide their potential reuse in future risk assessments. This review (i) identifies 11 and 7 recently published quantitative models and risk assessments for STEC and _L. monocytogenes_, respectively, in leafy greens, (ii) summarizes parameters, and (iii) reviews the underlying data sources or mathematical formulas used. A total of 80 key parameters (55 and 25 for STEC and L. monocytogenes, respectively, 10 shared) were extracted from the reviewed models across five supply chain stages, including: Preharvest, Harvest, Processing, Presentation to Consumer (Retail or Foodservice Locations), and Consumer Handling. Primary growth, secondary growth, and dose-response equations and parameters for STEC and _L. monocytogenes_ were also extracted . Additional literature reviews were performed if (i) certain key parameters were based on a single or a few data sources and (ii) key parameters were identified in a supply chain stage for one pathogen, but missing from the other.  The critical summaries of parameters presented here (i) provide a resource for future risk assessments, (ii) help define future data collection needs, and (iii) represent a starting point for similar reviews focusing on other produce commodities and pathogens.
