## Overview
In the past decade, several risk assessments for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Listeria monocytogenes have been developed to help guide management of these pathogens in various fresh produce commodities. However, there is a need to summarize and understand the sources of the parameters used in these models to better assess past and improve future risk assessments. This review identifies and then critically reviews 10 and 7 recently published, relevant risk assessments for STEC and L. monocytogenes, respectively, in leafy greens, aiming to extract and organize parameters for cross-study comparison of underlying data sources and mathematical formula. A total of 73 key parameters (53 and 20 for STEC and L. monocytogenes, respectively, 15 shared) were extracted across five stages in the produce supply chain, including (i) primary raw material production, (ii) harvest, (iii) packing houses and processing facilities, (iv) retail/food service, and (v) consumer storage and handling. For growth, die-off, and dose-response model parameters, 34 parameters were extracted for STEC and L. monocytogenes (17 each for STEC and L. monocytogenes, 6 shared). These analyses identified “consensus” parameters, used by most or all relevant risk assessments. Consensus parameters often came from a single or just a few sources, which limits the development of risk assessments that appropriately account for parameter variability and, particularly, uncertainty. While the summaries of parameter values presented here will provide a valuable reference list from which to pull values for future risk assessments, these also define future data needs, for example, to provide additional data for parameter estimates based on individual datasets. Future risk assessment may benefit from additional systematic review and meta-analyses of parameter estimates, and extension of this critical review and analysis to other pathogens, such as Salmonella.
